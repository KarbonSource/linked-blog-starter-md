# Rules of Dominant, Passive, and Symmetrical Hands
There are three types of categories of signs or words in ASL: One-handed, two-handed symmetrical, and two-handed non-symmetrical

For right handed people, the right hand is the dominant/active hand while the left hand is the passive or base hand.

**Note: Be sure to stay with your dominant hand consistently. Do not switch your dominant hand back and forth between your hands when signing. Choose one hand as your dominant hand and use that one consistently as you learn to sign.**
