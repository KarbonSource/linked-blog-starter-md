Linguist, who had initially ignored the sign languages of the world, began to demonstrate that they were natural languages equally capable of communicating abstract thought, emotion, and complex information as spoken languages. The result was that ASL was recognized as the foundation of a visually oriented deaf community.

40 years after the language gained academic recognition, schools have accepted sign language in classrooms; public events commonly include sign language interpreters; television and movie producers cast deaf actors; publishers welcome scholarly and popular books and articles on signing and deaf culture; students flock to sign language courses; and schools employ more deaf teachers, principals, superintendents. For some people, the most dramatic change is new pride in using their language in public.
