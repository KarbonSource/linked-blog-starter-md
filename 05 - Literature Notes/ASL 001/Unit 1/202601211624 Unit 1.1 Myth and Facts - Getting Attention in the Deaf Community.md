**Fact:** sign language depends on vision. To begin a conversation, you must first make eye contact with the person you want to sign to. If this person is not looking at you wave to catch their eye.

**Myth:** When you wave in this way, don't wave in the person's face or use huge waving gestures if you are close by. A slight flapping motion of the hand is enough

**Fact:** If waving fails and if you are near enough, tap the person's shoulder. Don't hesitate to tap, even if they are strangers; deaf community members are accustomed to such contact.

**Myth:** When touch a person to get their attention, don't tap to lightly, just once, or too often. Two or three firm but not heavy taps should be enough. Shoulders are the best places to tap until you know the person well.

**Fact:** If the person you want to sign to is at a distance, ask others to pass on your wave or tap until you get this person's attention
