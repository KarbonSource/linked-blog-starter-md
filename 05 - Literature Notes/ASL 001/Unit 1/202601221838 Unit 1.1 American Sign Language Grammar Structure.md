# All Languages have grammar
The structure of spoken language is rigid, with each word occupying a specific place in a sentence. Altering the order of verbs or adjectives would result in a sentence that needs coherence. However, different languages have varying levels of strictness in their grammar rules. Some languages allow for more flexibility in sentence structure, while others have more rigid rules. In any case, the sentence's subject is typically involved in the action being described.
