# All Languages have grammar
The structure of spoken language is rigid, with each word occupying a specific place in a sentence. Altering the order of verbs or adjectives would result in a sentence that needs coherence. However, different languages have varying levels of strictness in their grammar rules. Some languages allow for more flexibility in sentence structure, while others have more rigid rules. In any case, the sentence's subject is typically involved in the action being described.

# In English
Subject, Object, Verb are used -  in that particular order

# In ASL
Sing Language offers excellent grammar flexibility, permitting various word orders to convey the same idea. It is a common misconception that ASL is a signed version of English with the same grammar rules. This assumption is flawed. ASL is a distinct visual language with its unique syntax and grammar, separate from English. By examining English, we can observe its structure more closely.

Subject and Verb (OSV) are usually used in that particular order
- Simple example signers: Painting (point👉🏼) Jenny kiss fist (love it). "painting" is the object. "Jenny" is the subject, and "kiss fist" is the verb, 
- 2nd example signers: Starbucks I GO-TO. "Starbucks" is the object. "I" is the subject, and "go to" is the verb.
