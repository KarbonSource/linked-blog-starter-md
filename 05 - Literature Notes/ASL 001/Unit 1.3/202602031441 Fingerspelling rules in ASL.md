# Three rules of Fingerspelling
1: where should you fingerspell
	In front of your shoulder where it is comfortable, because it is easier to see the sign and your face

2: Double letters
	You do the letter twice, and when spelling a name for instance you can go left to right, making sure not to overdo it.

3: Do not bounce the letter.
