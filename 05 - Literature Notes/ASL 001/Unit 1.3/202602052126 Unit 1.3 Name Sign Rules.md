In the deaf community there are certain expectations as to how name signs are assigned to individuals

These name signs can be in two different categories: arbitrary and descriptive name signs

Arbitrary: name signs that have no iconic representative of the person

Descriptive: name signs that highlight a person's distinct physical feature, personality trait, or something that makes them stand out from others
