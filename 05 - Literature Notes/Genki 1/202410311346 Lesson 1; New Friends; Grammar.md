# XはYです
じゅうにじはんです。(It) is half past twelve
がくせいです。(I) am a student
にほんごです。(My major) is the Japanese language

It is important to see that none of these sentences don't have a "subject". Sentences without subjects are very common in Japanese; Japanese speakers tend to omit subjects whenever they think it is clear to the listener what or who they are referring to.

In order to make things explicit, we can say:
_____はにほんごです。 ______is the Japanese language.

Where ___ stands for the thing that is talked about, or the "topic" i.e.
せんこうはにほんごです　(my) major is the Japanese language.

pattern X wa Y desu to identify a person or a thing X as item Y.

わたしはスー・キムです　I am Sue Kim.
やましたさんはせんせいです　Mr. Yamashita is a teacher
メアリーさんはアメリカじんです　Mary is an American

は is a member of the class of words called "particles". Particles attach themselves to phrases and indicate how the phrases relate to the rest of the sentence.

# Question Sentences
To form a question at the end of a sentence just add か.
りゅうがくせいです。　(I am) an international student
りゅうがくせいですか。　(Are you) an international student?

The above question is a yes/no question.
Question sentences may also contain a question word like nan (what).

せんこうはなんですか,　えいごです
What is your major?    (my major) is English

いまなんじですか、　くじです。
What time is it now?       It is nine o'clock

なんねんせいですか。　にねんせいです。
What year are you in college?     I'm a sophomore.

でんわばんごうはなんですか。　186の7343です。
What is your phone number?       It is 186-7343.

# noun, の
No is a particle that connects two nouns. No is very versatile, it can act like the possessive "x's" in English.

たけしさんのでんわばんごう     Takeshi's phone number
たいがくのせんせい     A college professor
にほんごのがくせい    a student of the Japanese language
にほんのだいがく     A College in Japan

The main idea always comes at the end, with any further description placed before it.
