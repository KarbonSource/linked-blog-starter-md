N1: “If no forces act on a body, it will continue to move at the same speed, in the same direction”. If no force on a body then the velocity does not change. delta v is zero and acceleration is zero.

N2: The acceleration of a body is equal to the net force acting on that body divided by the mass of the body

N3: If body A exerts a force F on body B then body B will at exactly the same time exert a force on body A with the same magnitude, but opposite direction.

F<sub>AB</sub> = F<sub>BA</sub>
