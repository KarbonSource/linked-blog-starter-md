# Theory
A theory isn't a random thought or an unproven concept. It is an natural law based on observation and accepted fundamental principles.

No theory is ever regarded as the ultimate truth. It's always possible that new observations will require a theory to be revised. We can disprove a theory with inconsistencies, but we can never prove a theory is always correct.
