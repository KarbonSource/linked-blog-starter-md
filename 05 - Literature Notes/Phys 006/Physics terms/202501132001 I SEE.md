# Identify
- Use the physical conditions stated in the problem to help you decide which physics concepts are relevant.
- Identify the target variables of the problem - that is, the quantities whose values you're trying to find.
- Identify the known quantities as stated or implied in the problem. This step is essential whether the problem asks for an algebraic expression or a numerical answer.

# Set up
- Given the concepts, known quantities, and target variables, choose the equations that you'll use to solve the problem and decide how you'll use them.
- Make sure that the variables you have identified correlate exactly with those in the equations
- If appropriate, draw a sketch of the situation described in the problem

# Execute
- Do the math

# Evaluate
- Check your answer from the solve step to see if it reasonable. If your answer includes an algebraic expression confirm that it correctly represents what would happen if the variables it had very large or very small values.
