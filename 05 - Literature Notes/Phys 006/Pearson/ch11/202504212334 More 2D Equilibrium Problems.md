![[202504212334 More 2D Equilibrium Problems.png]]
With a 4 meter long beam at 30 degrees held at equilibrium and a unknown force is applied to the edge of the beam at an angle of 50 degrees. 

The weight of the beam acts on the object and the line of action is extended and once the force is split into it's xy-component, since the force is 50 degrees, extending the line of action means that the same 30 degree angle is present below the loa, and a 20 degree angle is above the loa.
