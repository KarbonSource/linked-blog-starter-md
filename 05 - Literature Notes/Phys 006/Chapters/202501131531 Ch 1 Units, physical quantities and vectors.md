# 1.1 The nature of physics
Physics can be described as a experimental science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns from experiments. These are called physical [[202501131925 Theory|theories]] or when they are very well established and widely used physical laws and principles.

In order for a Physical [[202501131925 Theory|theory]] to be developed an appropriate question must be asked and a experiment must be created to answer said question and draw a conclusion from the result.

# 1.2 Solving physics problems
In physics understanding a concepts means being able to apply it to a variety of problems. Learning how to solve problems is essential

This book will give you problem solving strategies and at the end of each chapter there will bridging problems

[[202501132001 I SEE|I SEE]] - short for identify, set up, execute, and evaluate.

## Idealized Models
we use the word "model" to mean either a small scale replica. In physics a model is a simplified version of a physical system that would be too complicated to analyze in full detail
 We have to be careful that we don't neglect too much.

# 1.3 Standards and Units
Experiments require measurements and we generally use numbers to describe the result of measurements. Any number that is used to describe a physical phenomenon quantitatively is called a [[202501140838 Physical Quantity|physical quantity]]

Sometimes we define a [[202501140838 Physical Quantity|physical quantity]] by describing how to calculate it from other quantities we can measure such as speed (distance (m) over time (s))

# 1.4 Using and converting units
We use equations to express relationships among physical quantities represented by algebraic symbols (example d=vt)

# 1.5 Uncertainty and significant figures
Measurements have uncertainties. The uncertainty is also called the error because it indicates the maximum difference there is likely to be between the measured value and the true value

We indicate the accuracy of a measured value with the symbol ± with a second number after indicating the uncertainty. We can also express accuracy in terms of the maximum likely fractional error or [[202501150723 Percent error|percent error]]

In many cases the uncertainty of a number is not explicitly stated. Instead, the uncertainty is indicated by the number of meaningful digits or sig figs (ex. 0.25 has two sig figs; 0.250 has three sig figs)

When multiplying or dividing the number of sig figs can have no more than the factor with the fewest sig figs

# 1.6 Estimates and orders of magnitude
Sometimes we know hot calculate a certain quantity, but we have to guess at the data we need for the calculation. Or the calculation might be to complicated to carry out exactly, so we need to make rough approximations. The result will also be guess that can be useful even if it's uncertain by about a factor of two or ten. this is called order of magnitude estimates

# 1.7 Vectors and Vector Addition
Other quantities in physics have a direction associated with them and cannot be described by a single number (example: speed combined with direction of its motion is velocity).

A [[202501140838 Physical Quantity|physical quantity]] is described with a single number is called a [[202501161423 Scalar quantity|scalar quantity]], A [[202501161424 Vector Quantity|vector quantity]] has both magnitude and direction. 

Displacement is a change in the position of an object. It is a [[202501161424 Vector Quantity|vector quantity]] because we must state how far an object moves and in what direction. We usually represent Vector symbols with an arrow above them. This is to remind us that vectors are different from scalar quantities.

If two vectors move in the same direction they are parallel, if they also have the magnitude they are equal no matter where they are located
![[Pasted image 20250116190437.png|200]]
In disposition if vector 1 has the same magnitude of vector 2 but moves in the opposite direction, vector 1 is equal to the negative of vector 2
![[Pasted image 20250116190853.png|200]]
When to vector move in the opposite direction whether they have the same magnitude or not they are antiparallel. The magnitude of a [[202501161424 Vector Quantity|vector quantity]] is scalar and is always positive

## Vector Addition and Subtraction
Vector C is the Vector sum or resultant of the displacement of Vector A and Vector B
![[Pasted image 20250116194724.png|100]]

The order of terms in a vector sum doesn't matter. In other words vector addition obeys the commutative law.

# 1.8 Components of Vectors
![[Pasted image 20250117072032.png|200]]
For Vector A we begin with a rectangular coordinate system of axes. If we think of vector A as a displacement vector, we can regard vector A as the sum of a displacement parallel to the x and y axis, these are labeled as A<sub>x</sub> and A<sub>y</sub>. A<sub>x</sub> and A<sub>y</sub> these are the components of vectors
![[Pasted image 20250117073256.png|400]]
We can calculate the components of vector A if we know the magnitude A and its direction. The direction of the vector will be described by its angle relative to some reference direction

## Using Components to do Vector Calculations


# 1.9 [[202501170756 Unit Vectors|Unit Vectors]]
A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of 1, with no units. It's only purpose is to point-- that is, to describe the direction in space

[[202501170756 Unit Vectors|Unit vectors]] provide a convenient notation for many expressions involving component of vectors. we always include a caret or hat (^)

In a xy-coordinate system we define unit vector $\hat{i}$ that points in the direction of the positive x-axis. We define unit vector $\hat{j}$ that points in the direction of the positive y-axis.
![[Pasted image 20250117081726.png|150]]

Using [[202501170756 Unit Vectors|unit vectors]] we can describe $\overrightarrow{R}$ as the vector sum of two vectors $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$
![[Pasted image 20250117082143.png|200]]
vector k^ points in the direction of the positive z-axis

# 1.10 Products of Vectors
Vectors are not ordinary numbers, so we can't directly apply ordinary multiplication to vectors. Scalar product yields a result that is a [[202501161423 Scalar quantity|scalar quantity]]. The second, the vector product, yields another vector.

## Scalar Product
To define the scalar product $\overrightarrow{A}$ $\cdot$ $\overrightarrow{B}$ we draw the two vectors A and B with their tails at the same point. The angle $\phi$ between their direction.
![[Pasted image 20250117102024.png|300]]![[Pasted image 20250117102044.png|300]]![[Pasted image 20250117102119.png|300]]
![[Pasted image 20250117103057.png|]]
We can define $\overrightarrow{A}$ $\cdot$ $\overrightarrow{B}$ to be the magnitude of $\overrightarrow{B}$ multiplied by the components of $\overrightarrow{A}$  in the direction of $\overrightarrow{B}$ 

The scalar product is a [[202501161423 Scalar quantity|scalar quantity]], not a vector, and it may be positive, negative, or zero.

when $\phi$ is between 0 and 90 degrees, cos$\phi$ > 0 and the scalar product is positive. When $\phi$ is between 90 and 180 degrees so cos$\phi$ < 0, the component of $\overrightarrow{B}$ in the direction of $\overrightarrow{A}$ is negative, and $\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}$ is negative. Finally, when $\phi$ = 90 degrees $\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}=0$ . The scalar product of two perpendicular vectors is always zero.
![[Pasted image 20250117195023.png|250]]
For any two vectors $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$ , $ABcos\phi\ = BAcos\phi$ this means that $\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B} = \overrightarrow{B}\cdot\overrightarrow{A}$. The scalar product obeys the commutative law of multiplication; the order of the two vectors doesn't matter.

## Using components to Calculate the scalar product
We can calculate the scalar product $\overrightarrow{A}\cdot\overrightarrow{B}$ directly if we know the x-,y- and z-components of $\overrightarrow{A}$ and $\overrightarrow{B}$
