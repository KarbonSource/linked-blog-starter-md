# 8.1 Momentum and Impulse
In chapter 6 Newton's second is described as the following

$\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}} = m\overrightarrow{a}$

## Newton's Second Law in terms of momentum
Because $\overrightarrow{a}=\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{dt}$ Newton's second law can be rewrite as

$\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}=m\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(m\overrightarrow{v})$

Thus Newton's second law says that the external force $\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}$ acting on a particle equals the time rat of change of the product of the particle's mass and velocity, this is called product of momentum, or linear momentum of the particle

The greater the mass m and speed v of a, the greater is its magnitude of the momentum mv. This is a vector quantity with the same direction as the particle's velocity.

Momentum is often described by its components xyz

The net external force acting on a particle equals the time rate of change of momentum of the particle.
