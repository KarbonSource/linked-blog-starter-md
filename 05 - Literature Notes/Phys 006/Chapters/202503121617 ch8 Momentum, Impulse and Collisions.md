# 8.1 Momentum and Impulse
In chapter 6 Newton's second is described as the following

$\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}} = m\overrightarrow{a}$

## Newton's Second Law in terms of momentum
Because $\overrightarrow{a}=\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{dt}$ Newton's second law can be rewrite as

$\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}=m\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(m\overrightarrow{v})$

Thus Newton's second law says that the external force $\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}$ acting on a particle equals the time rat of change of the product of the particle's mass and velocity, this is called product of momentum, or linear momentum of the particle

The greater the mass m and speed v of a, the greater is its magnitude of the momentum mv. This is a vector quantity with the same direction as the particle's velocity.

Momentum is often described by its components xyz

The net external force acting on a particle equals the time rate of change of momentum of the particle.

## The Impulse-Momentum Theorem
Both a particle's momentum $\overrightarrow{p}=m\overrightarrow{v}$ and its kinetic energy k=$\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ depend on the mass and velocity of the particle.

Impulse is a vector quantity; its direction is the same as the net external force $\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}$. The Si unit of impulse is the Newton times second Ns.

The impulse-momentum theorem also holds when forces are not constant

# 8.2 Conservation of Momentum
The concept of momentum is particularly important in situations in which we have two or more objects that interact.

For any system, the forces that the particles of the system exert on each other are called internal forces.

Forces exerted on any part of the system by some object outside are called external forces
![[202503121617 ch8 Momentum, Impulse and Collisions-5.png]]
**Conservation of Momentum** if the vector sum of the external forces on a system is zero, the total momentum of the system is constant

This is the simplest form of the principle of conservation of momentum. This principle is a direct consequence of Newton's third law

# 8.3 Momentum Conservation and Collisions
If the forces between the colliding objects are much larger than any external forces, as is the case in most collisions, we can ignore the external forces and treat the objects as an isolated system.
