# 8.1 Momentum and Impulse
In chapter 6 Newton's second is described as the following

$\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}} = m\overrightarrow{a}$

## Newton's Second Law in terms of momentum
Because $\overrightarrow{a}=\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{dt}$ Newton's second law can be rewrite as

$\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}=m\frac{d\overrightarrow{v}}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(m\overrightarrow{v})$

Thus Newton's second law says that the external force $\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}$ acting on a particle equals the time rat of change of the product of the particle's mass and velocity, this is called product of momentum, or linear momentum of the particle
