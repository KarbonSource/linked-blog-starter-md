# 2.1 Displacement, time, and average velocity
Average velocity is the $\frac{DeltaDistance}{DeltaTime}$ (m/s)

V<sub>av-x</sub> = $\frac{DeltaDistance}{Deltatime}$ = $\frac{x2-x1}{t2-t1}$ 

The formula above means average x-velocity where the subscript “av” signifies average value and the subscript x indicates that this is the x-component

The average velocity will be positive when the particle moves in the positive direction as time goes on. The average velocity will be negative when the particle moves in the negative direction as time goes on

We can graph a particle’s position as a function of time, that is a x-t graph. The graph represents the particle position changes with time. If we draw a straight line from P1 to P2, we can form a right triangle and the hypotenuse represent the average velocity 

# 2.2 Instantaneous Velocity
Instantaneous velocity means the velocity at a specific instant of time or specific point along the path.

In order to find the instantaneous velocity at P1, we have to move P2 closer and closer to P1 and compute the average velocity V<sub>av-x</sub> over the even shorter displacement and time interval. Both delta x and delta t become very small. This is known in calculus as the derivative when the lim of delta x/delta t approaches zero (derivative of x with respect to t written as dx/dt). We use the symbol V<sub>x</sub> for instantaneous velocity along the x-axis or the instantaneous x-velocity.

the time interval delta t will always be positive, so v<sub>x</sub> will always have the same sign as delta x

Instantaneous velocity is a vector much like average velocity defines its x-component

## Finding Velocity on an x-t graph
As P2 approaches P1, the average x-velocity is calculated over shorter time intervals

On a graph of position as a function of time for straight-line motion, the instantaneous x-velocity at any point is equal to the slope of the tangent to the curve at that point

If the tangent to the x-t curve slopes upward to the right then it’s slope is positive, the x-velocity is positive, and the motion is in the positive direction. If the tangent slope downward to the right the x-velocity and the motion is in the negative x-direction

# 2.3 Average and instantaneous Acceleration
Acceleration is described as the rate of change of velocity with time. Acceleration is a vector quantity. In physics, acceleration refers to any velocity change, so and object is either speeding up or slowing down when referring to acceleration.

## Average acceleration
![[Pasted image 20250119152944.png]]
The x-component of velocity changes by $\Delta{V}$<sub>X</sub> = V<sub>2x</sub> - V<sub>1x</sub> during the time interval $\Delta{t}$ = t<sub>2</sub> - t<sub>1</sub>. As the particle moves from P<sub>1</sub> to P<sub>2</sub>, its average acceleration is a vector quantity whose x-component a<sub>av-x</sub> (Average x-acceleration) equals $\Delta{v}$<sub>x</sub>, the change in the x-component of velocity, divided by the time interval $\Delta{t}$ 

Acceleration is m/s<sup>2</sup> 

## Instantaneous Acceleration
We can define Instant Acceleration the same way we define instantaneous velocity. We take P<sub>2</sub> to be closer and closer to P<sub>1</sub> so that the average acceleration is computed over shorter and shorter time intervals

## Finding Acceleration on a v<sub>x</sub>-t graph or an x-t graph
We interpret average and instantaneous x-velocity in terms of the slope of a graph of position versus time. In the same way, we can interpret average and instantaneous x-acceleration by using a graph of instantaneous velocity v<sub>x</sub> versus time
![[Pasted image 20250120180128.png|400]]
a<sub>x</sub> = $\frac{dv_x}{dt}$ = $\frac{d}{dt}$($\frac{dx}{dt}$) = $\frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$

a<sub>x</sub> is the second derivative of x with respect to t. The second derivative of any function is directly related to the concavity or curvature of the graph function. 
![[Pasted image 20250121160305.png]]
At a point where x-t is concave upward, the x-acceleration is positive and v<sub>x</sub> ins increasing. At a point where the x-t graph is concave down the x-acceleration is negative and v<sub>x</sub> is decreasing. At a point where the x-t graph has no curvature such as the inflection points the x-acceleration is zero and the velocity is not changing.

# 2.4 Motion with constant acceleration
![[Pasted image 20250121161056.png|300]]
The simplest kind of acceleration motion is straight-line motion with constant acceleration. With the example above velocity changes at a constant rate

When the x-acceleration a<sub>x</sub> is a constant, the average x-acceleration     a<sub>av-x</sub> for any time interval is the same as a<sub>x</sub> 

In order to find v<sub>x</sub> we need to take the equation a<sub>x</sub> = $\frac{v_2x-v_1x}{t_2-t_1}$

We let t<sub>1</sub> = 0 and let t<sub>2</sub> be any later time t. we use the symbol v<sub>0x</sub> for the initial x-velocity at time t = 0 the equation becomes

ax = $\frac{v_x-v_0x}{t-0}$ or v<sub>x</sub> = v<sub>0x</sub> + a<sub>x</sub>t
![[Pasted image 20250121173640.png|400]]

the term a<sub>x</sub>t is the product of the constant rate of change of x-velocity, it equals the total change in x-velocity from t=0 to time t. the x-velocity v<sub>x</sub> at any time t then equal the initial x-velocity v<sub>0x</sub> (at t=0) plus the change in x-velocity a<sub>x</sub>t

The last equation tells us that the particle's position at time t is the sum of three terms: its initial position at t = 0, x<sub>0</sub> plus the displacement v<sub>0x</sub>t it would have if its x-velocity remained equal to its initial value, plus an additional displacement $\frac{1}{2}$a<sub>x</sub>t<sup>2</sup> caused by the change in x-velocity.
# 2.5 Freely Falling Objects
nearly constant acceleration is an object falling under the influence of gravity. All objects at a particular location fall with the same downward acceleration, regardless of their size or weight

The constant acceleration of a freely falling object is called the acceleration due to gravity and we denote its magnitude with the letter g

g = 9.80 m/s<sup>2</sup> = 980 cm/s<sup>2</sup> = 32.2 ft/s<sup>2</sup> 

g is always a positive number.
