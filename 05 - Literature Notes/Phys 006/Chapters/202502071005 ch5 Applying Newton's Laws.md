# 5.1 Using Newton's First Law: Particles in Equilibrium
Equilibrium is an object at rest or moving with constant velocity in an inertial frame of reference. The essential physical principle is Newton's first law:

The tension at any point in the rope is the magnitude of the force that acts at that point.

# 5.2 Using Newton's Second's Law: Dynamics of Particles
In Dynamics problems, we apply Newton's second law to objects on which the net force is not zero. These objects are not in equilibrium and hence are accelerating:

m$\overrightarrow{a}$ does not belong on a FBD, because m$\overrightarrow{a}$ is the result of forces of forces acting on an object, not a force itself. When you draw the FBD for an accelerating object never include the m$\overrightarrow{a}$ force because there is no such force

# 5.3 Friction Forces
Whenever two objects interact by direct contact of their surfaces, we describe the interaction in terms of contact forces.. The normal force for example of a contact force.

Friction is important in many aspects of everyday life. without friction between the tires and the road we couldn't drive or turn the car

## Kinetic and static Friction
First, when an object rests or slides on a surface, we can think of the surface exerting a single contact force on the object, with force components perpendicular and parallel to the surface
![[Pasted image 20250208104831.png|250]]
The perpendicular component vector is the normal force, denoted by $\overrightarrow{n}$. The component vector parallel to the surface (and perpendicular to $\overrightarrow{n}$) is the **friction force**, denoted by $\overrightarrow{f}$. if the surface is friction less, then $\overrightarrow{f}$ is zero but there is still a normal force. The direction of the friction force is always such as to oppose relative motion of the tow surfaces

the kind of friction that acts when an object slides over a surface is called **kinetic friction force** $\overrightarrow{f_k}$. The adjective "kinetic" and the subscript "k" remind us that the two surfaces are moving relative to each other. The magnitude of the kinetic friction force usually increases when the normal force increases (example: more force to slide a box full of books than an empty one).
![[Pasted image 20250208113851.png|450]]
Here $\mu_k$ is a constant called the **coefficient of kinetic friction**. The more slippery the surface, the smaller this coefficient. Because it is a quotient of two magnitudes, $\mu_k$ is a pure number without units.

Friction forces may also act when there is no relative motion. If you try to slide a box across the floor, the box may not move at all because the floor exerts an equal and opposite friction force on the box. This is called **static friction** $\overrightarrow{f_s}$.
![[Pasted image 20250208115534.png|]]
In the figure above, a box is at rest (equilibrium) under the action of its weight $\overrightarrow{w}$ and the upward normal force $\overrightarrow{n}$. the normal force is equal in magnitude to the weight (n = w) and is exerted on the box by floor.

Then we gradually increase the tension (T) of the rope. The experiment shows that in many cases this maximum value, called (f<sub>s</sub>)<sub>max</sub> is approximately proportional to n; we call the proportionality factor $\mu_s$ the coefficient of static friction.
![[Pasted image 20250208123842.png]]
$$
{f_{s}}\leq(f_{s})_{max}=\mu_{s}n
$$
As soon as the box starts to slide, the friction force usually decreases; it's easier to keep the box moving than to start it moving. Hence the coefficient of kinetic friction is usually less than the coefficient of static friction for any give pair of surfaces.

## Rolling Friction
It is easier to move something on a cart, but how much easier? we can define a **coefficient of rolling friction** $\mu_r$, which is the horizontal force needed for constant speed on a flat surface divided by the upward normal force exerted by the surface.

## Fluid Resistance and Terminal Speed
**Fluid Resistance**, the force that a fluid (a gas or liquid) exerts on an object moving through it. The moving object exerts a force on the fluid to push it out of the way. By Newton's third law, the fluid pushes back on the object with an equal and opposite force.
