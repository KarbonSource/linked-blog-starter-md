# 5.1 Using Newton's First Law: Particles in Equilibrium
Equilibrium is an object at rest or moving with constant velocity in an inertial frame of reference. The essential physical principle is Newton's first law:

The tension at any point in the rope is the magnitude of the force that acts at that point.

# 5.2 Using Newton's Second's Law: Dynamics of Particles
In Dynamics problems, we apply Newton's second law to objects on which the net force is not zero. These objects are not in equilibrium and hence are accelerating:

m$\overrightarrow{a}$ does not belong on a FBD, because m$\overrightarrow{a}$ is the result of forces of forces acting on an object, not a force itself. When you draw the FBD for an accelerating object never include the m$\overrightarrow{a}$ force because there is no such force
