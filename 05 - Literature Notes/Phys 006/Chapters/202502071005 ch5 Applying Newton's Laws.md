# 5.1 Using Newton's First Law: Particles in Equilibrium
Equilibrium is an object at rest or moving with constant velocity in an inertial frame of reference. The essential physical principle is Newton's first law:

The tension at any point in the rope is the magnitude of the force that acts at that point.

# 5.2 Using Newton's Second's Law: Dynamics of Particles
In Dynamics problems, we apply Newton's second law to objects on which the net force is not zero. These objects are not in equilibrium and hence are accelerating:

m$\overrightarrow{a}$ does not belong on a FBD, because m$\overrightarrow{a}$ is the result of forces of forces acting on an object, not a force itself. When you draw the FBD for an accelerating object never include the m$\overrightarrow{a}$ force because there is no such force

# 5.3 Friction Forces
Whenever two objects interact by direct contact of their surfaces, we describe the interaction in terms of contact forces.. The normal force for example of a contact force.

Friction is important in many aspects of everyday life. without friction between the tires and the road we couldn't drive or turn the car

## Kinetic and static Friction
First, when an object rests or slides on a surface, we can think of the surface exerting a single contact force on the object, with force components perpendicular and parallel to the surface

The perpendicular component vector is the normal force, denoted by $\overrightarrow{n}$. The component vector parallel to the surface (and perpendicular to $\overrightarrow{n}$) is the **friction force**, denoted by $\overrightarrow{f}$. if the surface is friction less, then $\overrightarrow{f}$ is zero but there is still a normal force. The direction of the friction force is always such as to oppose relative motion of the tow surfaces

the kind of friction that acts when an object slides over a surface is called **kinetic friction force** $\overrightarrow{f_k}$. The adjective "kinetic" and the subscript "k" remind us that the two surfaces are moving relative to each other. The magnitude of the kinetic friction force usually increases when the normal force increases (example: more force to slide a box full of books than an empty one).

Here $\mu_k$ is a constant called the **coefficient of kinetic friction**.
