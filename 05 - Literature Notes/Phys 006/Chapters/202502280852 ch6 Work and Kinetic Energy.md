# Work
Work - any activity that requires muscular or mental effort.

you do work by exerting a force on an object while that object moves from one place to another - that is, undergoes a displacement. You do more work if the force is greater or if the displacement is greater. While the object moves, a constant force $\overrightarrow{F}$ acts on it in the same direction as the displacement $\overrightarrow{s}$ 

We define the **work** W done by the this constant force under these circumstances as the product of the force magnitude F and the displace magnitude s

W = Fs (constant force in direction of straight-line displacement)

The SI unit of work is the **joulle** (J)

1 joule = (1 newton)(1 meter)
