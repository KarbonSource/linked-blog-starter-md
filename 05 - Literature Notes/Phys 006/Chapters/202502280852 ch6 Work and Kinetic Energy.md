# 6.1 Work
Work - any activity that requires muscular or mental effort.

you do work by exerting a force on an object while that object moves from one place to another - that is, undergoes a displacement. You do more work if the force is greater or if the displacement is greater. While the object moves, a constant force $\overrightarrow{F}$ acts on it in the same direction as the displacement $\overrightarrow{s}$ 

We define the **work** W done by the this constant force under these circumstances as the product of the force magnitude F and the displace magnitude s

W = Fs (constant force in direction of straight-line displacement)

The SI unit of work is the **joule** (J)

1 joule = (1 newton)(1 meter)

## Work: Positive, Negative, or Zero
When the force has a component in the same direction as the displacement, cos$\alpha$  is positive and the work W is positive. When the force has a component opposite to the displacement, cos $\alpha$ is negative and the work is negative. When the force is perpendicular to the displacement $\alpha$ = 90<sup>o</sup> and the work done by the force is zero. 

## Total Work
Because work is a scalar quantity, the total work W<sub>tot</sub> done on the object by all the forces is the algebraic sum of the quantities of work done by the individual forces.

# 6.2 Kinetic Friction and the Work-Energy Theorem
The total work done on an object by external force is related to the object’s displacement, but the total work is also related to changes in the speed of the object
![[99 - Meta/202502280852 ch6 Work and Kinetic Energy-2.png]]particle is a scalar quantity, it only depends on the particle’s mass and speed, kinetic energy can never be negative and is only zero when a particle is at rest
![[99 - Meta/Images/202502280852 ch6 Work and Kinetic Energy-2.png]]
when W<sub>tot</sub> is positive, the kinetic energy increases and the particle is going faster at the end of the displacement than at the beginning
