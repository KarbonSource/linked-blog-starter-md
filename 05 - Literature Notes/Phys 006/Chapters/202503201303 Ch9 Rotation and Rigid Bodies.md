# 9.1 Angular Velocity and Acceleration
![[202503201303 Ch9 Rotation and Rigid Bodies.png]]
The angular coordinate $\theta$ of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis can be both positive and negative, depending on which to be positive or negative to be clockwise or counterclockwise.

The most natural way to measure the angle $\theta$ is not in degrees but in **radians**.

$\theta=\frac{s}{r}$ or $s=r\theta$

An angle in radians is the ratio of two lengths, so it is a pure number, without dimensions.

The circumference of a circle is 2$\pi$ times the radius, so there are 2$\pi$ (about 6.283) radians in one complete revolution therefore

1 rad = $\frac{360^{o}}{2\pi}$ = 57.3<sup>o</sup> 

## Angular Velocity
![[202503201303 Ch9 Rotation and Rigid Bodies-1.png]]
A rotating body makes an angle $\theta_1$ with the $\pm$x x at time t<sub>1</sub>. At a later time t<sub>2</sub> the angle has changed to $\theta_2$. We define the average angular velocity $\omega_{av-z}$ (the Greek letter Omega) of the body in the time interval $\Delta{t}=t_2-t_1$ as the ratio of the angular displacement $\Delta{\theta}=\theta_2-\theta_1$ to $\Delta{t}$

$\omega_{av-z}=\frac{\theta_2-\theta_1}{t_2-t_1}=\frac{\Delta{\theta}}{\Delta{t}}$

The instantaneous angular velocity $\omega_z$ is the limit of $\omega_{av-z}$ as $\Delta{t}$ approaches zero:

## Angular Velocity as a Vector
Just as v<sub>x</sub> is  the x-component of the velocity vector $\overrightarrow{v}$, $\omega_z$ is the z-component of an angular velocity vector $\overrightarrow{\omega}$ directed along the axis of rotation.

## Angular Acceleration
A rigid body whose angular velocity changes has an angular acceleration.

# 9.2 Rotation with Constant Angular Acceleration

The product a<sub>z</sub>t is the total change in $\omega_z$ between t = 0 and the later time t; angular velocity w<sub>z</sub> at time t is the sum of the initial value w<sub>0z</sub> and this total change.

# 9.3 Relating Linear and Angular Kinematics
To find the kinetic energy of a rotating body, we have to star from   KE = $\frac{1}{2}mv^2$ for a particle, and this requires that we know the speed v for each particle in the body

## Linear Speed in Rigid-Body Rotation
![[202503201303 Ch9 Rotation and Rigid Bodies-9.png|350]]![[Pasted image 20250320200215.png|350]]
A particle's speed is directly proportional to the body's angular velocity; the faster the rotation, the greater the speed of each particle

s = r$\theta$ 

We take the derivative with r being a constant
$|\frac{ds}{dt}=r|\frac{d\theta}{dt}|$

## Linear Acceleration in Rigid-Body Rotation
We can can represent the acceleration $\overrightarrow{a}$ of a particle moving in a circle in terms of its centripetal and tangential components a<sub>rad</sub> and a<sub>tan</sub>. We found that the **tangential component of acceleration** a<sub>tan</sub> the component parallel to the instantaneous velocity, acts to change the magnitude of the particles velocity

This component of acceleration is always tangent to the circular path of point P
