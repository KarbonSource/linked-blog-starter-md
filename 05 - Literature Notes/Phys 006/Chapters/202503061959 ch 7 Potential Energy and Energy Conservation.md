# 7.1 Gravitational Potential Energy
The potential energy associated with the object's weight and its height above the ground is called gravitational potential energy. There are two ways to describe what happens when an object falls without air resistance.

One way was from ch6 that a falling object's kinetic energy increases because the force of the earth's gravity does work on the object.

The other way is to say that the kinetic energy increases as the gravitational potential energy decreases.

W<sub>grav</sub> = Fs = w(y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>) = mgy<sub>1</sub> - mgy<sub>2</sub> 

The expression above gives the correct work when the object moves upward and y<sub>2</sub> is greater than y<sub>1</sub>. in that case (y<sub>1</sub> - y<sub>2</sub>) is negative, and W<sub>grav</sub> is negativ
