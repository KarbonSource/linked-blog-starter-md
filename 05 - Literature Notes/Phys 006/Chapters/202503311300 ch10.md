# Torque
the point on the object where the force is applied.

The object can rotate about an axis that is perpendicular to the plane of the figure.

# 10.3 Rigid-Body Rotation about a Moving Axis
The motion of the rigid body is combined translation and rotation. they key to understanding such situations in this: every possible motion of a rigid body can be represented as a combination of translational motion of the center of mass and rotation about an axis through the center of mass.

## Rolling Without Slipping
Its center of mass is at it geometric center.

## Combined Translation and Rotation: Dynamics
We can also analyze the combined translational and rotational motions of a rigid body from the standpoint of dynamics.

The rotational motion about the center of mass is described by the rotational analog of Newton's second law

## Rolling Friction
We said that we can ignore rolling friction if both the rolling body and surface over which it rolls are perfectly rigid. There is no sliding at the point of contact, so the friction force does no work
