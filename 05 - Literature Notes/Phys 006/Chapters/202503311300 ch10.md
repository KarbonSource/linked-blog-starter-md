# Torque
the point on the object where the force is applied.

# 10.3 Rigid-Body Rotation about a Moving Axis
The motion of the rigid body is combined translation and rotation. they key to understanding such situations in this: every possible motion of a rigid body can be represented as a combination of translational motion of the center of mass and rotation about an axis through the center of mass.

## Rolling Without Slipping
Its center of mass is at it geometric center.
