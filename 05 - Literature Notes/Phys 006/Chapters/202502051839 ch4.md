# 4.1 Force and Interactions
A **force** is a push or a pull. A force is an interaction between two objects or between an object and its environment. It is always referred to the force that one object exerts on a second object. Force is a [[202501161424 Vector Quantity|vector quantity]] objects can be pushed or pulled in several directions.

When a force involves direct contact, push or pull, this is called a  contact force. There are three types of contact forces.

---
**Normal Force**: a force exerted on an object by any surface with which it is in contact with. A perpendicular force

**Friction Force**: A force exerted on an object by a surface acts parallel to the surface, in the direction that opposes sliding.

**Tension Force**: The pulling force exerted by a stretched rope or cord on an object to which it's attached

---
In addition  to contact forces there are long-range forces that act even when the objects are separated by an empty space. Examples include magnets and gravity.

The gravitational force that the ear exerts on your body is called your **weight**

To describe a force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$, we need to describe the direction in which it acts as well as the magnitude of the force pushes or pulls. The SI unit for force is the newton N.

---
Forces applied at a point on an object have the same effect as a single force equal to the vector sum of the force. **Superposition Forces**. 

We add force vectors by its components in terms of $\overrightarrow{F}$.

We often need to find the vector sum of all forces acting on an object. this is called net force acting on an object $\Sigma{F}$.

So $\Sigma{F}$ is read as the vector sum of force or the net force.

R<sub>x</sub> = $\Sigma{F}$<sub>x</sub>   R<sub>y</sub> = $\Sigma{F}$<sub>y</sub> 

Once we have R<sub>x</sub> and R<sub>y</sub> we can find the magnitude and direction of the net force $\overrightarrow{R}$ = $\Sigma$$\overrightarrow{F}$ acting on the object. The magnitude is

R = (R<sub>x</sub><sup>2</sup> + R<sub>y</sub><sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>

and the angle $\theta$ between $\overrightarrow{R}$ and the + x-axis can be found from the relationship tan$\theta$ = R<sub>y</sub>/R<sub>x</sub>. Both components of R may be positive, negative or zero and the angle may be in any of the four quadrants.

In three dimensional problems we will also have a z-component

# 4.2 Newtons First Law
The forces that affect an object's motion are **external force**, those forces exerted on the object by other objects in its environment.

when no net external force acts on an object, the object either remains at rest or moves with constant velocity in a straight line.

The tendency of an object to keep moving once it is set in motion is called **inertia**. 

When an object is either at rest or moving with constant velocity, we say that the object is in **equilibrium**. For an object to be in equilibrium, it must be acted on by no forces, or by several forces such that their vector sum that is, the net external force - is zero:

## Inertial Frames of Reference
A frame of reference in which Newton's first law is valid is called an inertial frame of reference, sometimes called the law of inertia.

# 4.3 Newton's Second Law
## Mass and Force
the ratio of the magnitude |$\overrightarrow{F}$| of the net external force to the magnitude a = |$\overrightarrow{a}$| of the acceleration is constant, regardless of the magnitude of the net external force.

m = $\frac{|\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}|}{a}$  or  |$\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}}$| = ma  or  a = $\frac{|\Sigma{\overrightarrow{F}|}}{m}$

Mass is a quantitative measure of inertia. The greater an object’s mass, the more the object “resists” being accelerated. The SI unit of mass is the **kilogram**.
