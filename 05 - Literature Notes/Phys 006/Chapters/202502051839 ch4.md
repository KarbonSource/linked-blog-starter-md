# 4.1 Force and Interactions
A **force** is a push or a pull. A force is an interaction between two objects or between an object and its environment. It is always referred to the force that one object exerts on a second object. Force is a [[202501161424 Vector Quantity|vector quantity]] objects can be pushed or pulled in several directions.

When a force involves direct contact, push or pull, this is called a  contact force. There are three types of contact forces.

**Normal Force**: a force exerted on an object by any surface with which it is in contact with. A perpendicular force

**Friction Force**: A force exerted on an object by a surface acts parallel to the surface, in the direction that opposes sliding.

**Tension Force**: The pulling force exerted by a stretched rope or cord on an object to which it's attached

In addition  to contact forces there are long-range forces that act even when the objects are separated by an empty space. Examples include magnets and gravity.

The gravitational force that the ear exerts on your body is called your **weight**

To describe a force vector $\overrightarrow{F}$, we need to describe the direction in which it acts as well as the magnitude of the force pushes or pulls. The SI unit for force is the newton N.
