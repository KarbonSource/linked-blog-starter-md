# Traffic Lanes
A traffic lane is a section of road for a single line of traffic.

# Lane Markings
Lane markings on road surfaces help drivers know which part of the road to use and understand traffic rules.

## Single solid yellow line
A single solid yellow line marks the center of a road with two-way traffic. Don't pass a vehicle in front of you if there is only one lane of traffic going your direction and a solid yellow line on your side of the road.

## Double Solid Yellow lines
Don't pass over double solid yellow lines. Stay to the right of these lines unless you are:
- In a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) carpool lane that has a designated entrance on the left
- instructed by a construction or other signs to drive on the other side of the road because your side is closed or blocked
- Turning left across a single set of double yellow lines to enter or exit a driveway or private road or make a U-turn.
Two sets of solid double yellow lines spaced tow or more feet apart are considered a barrier

# Broken Yellow Line
A broken yellow line indicates you may pass if the broken line is next to your driving lane. Only pass when it's safe.

# Single Solid White Line
A single solid white line marks traffic lanes going in the same direction

# Double Solid White Lines
Double solid white lines indicate a lane barrier between a regular use and a preferential use lane, such as a carpool lane. You may also see double solid white lines in or near freeway on and off ramps. Never change lanes over double solid white lines. Wait until you see a single broken white line

# Broken white lines
broken white lines separate traffic lanes on roads with two or more lanes in the same direction.
