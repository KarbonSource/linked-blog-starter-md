# Traffic Lanes
A traffic lane is a section of road for a single line of traffic.

# Lane Markings
Lane markings on road surfaces help drivers know which part of the road to use and understand traffic rules.

## Single solid yellow line
A single solid yellow line marks the center of a road with two-way traffic. Don't pass a vehicle in front of you if there is only one lane of traffic going your direction and a solid yellow line on your side of the road.

## Double Solid Yellow lines
Don't pass over double solid yellow lines. Stay to the right of these lines unless you are:
- In a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) carpool lane that has a designated entrance on the left
- instructed by a construction or other signs to drive on the other side of the road because your side is closed or blocked
- Turning left across a single set of double yellow lines to enter or exit a driveway or private road or make a U-turn.
Two sets of solid double yellow lines spaced tow or more feet apart are considered a barrier

## Broken Yellow Line
A broken yellow line indicates you may pass if the broken line is next to your driving lane. Only pass when it's safe.

## Single Solid White Line
A single solid white line marks traffic lanes going in the same direction

## Double Solid White Lines
Double solid white lines indicate a lane barrier between a regular use and a preferential use lane, such as a carpool lane. You may also see double solid white lines in or near freeway on and off ramps. Never change lanes over double solid white lines. Wait until you see a single broken white line

## Broken white lines
broken white lines separate traffic lanes on roads with two or more lanes in the same direction.

## End of lane Markings
Ending freeway and street lanes are usually marked with large broken lines. If you are driving in a lane marked with broken lines, be prepared to exit the freeway or for the lane to end. Look for a sign that tells you to exit or merge.

## Yield Line
A yield line is a line of solid white triangles that shows approaching vehicles where to yield or stop. The triangles point towards approaching vehicles.

# Choosing a lane
Traffic lanes are often referred to by number. the left (or fast) lane is called the number 1 lane. The lane to the right of number 1 lane is called number 2 lane, then number 3 and so on.

Some tips for choosing a lane:
- Use the left lane to pass or turn left
- Use the right lane to enter or exit traffic or when you enter the road from a curb or shoulder

# Changing Lanes
before you change lanes:
- Signal
- Check your mirrors
- Check traffic behind and beside you
- Look over your shoulder in the direction you plan to move to make sure the lane is clear
- Check you blind spots for other vehicles. Do not let the vehicle drift into another lane
- Be sure there is enough space for your vehicle in the next lane. It is not necessary to slow down before a lane change.

Stay in one lane as much as possible. Last minute lane or direction changes may increase the risk of collisions. Once you start moving through an intersection, keep going. If you start to make a turn, follow through. If you miss a turn, keep driving until you can safely and legally turn around.
