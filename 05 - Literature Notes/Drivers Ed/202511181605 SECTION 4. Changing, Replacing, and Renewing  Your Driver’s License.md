# SECTION 4. Changing, Replacing, and Renewing Your Driver’s License

# Change your address
If you move you must notify the DMV of your new address within ten days.
You don't automatically get a new driver's license when you change your address. You may request a replacement for a fee.

# Replace or renew your driver's license
It is against the law to drive with an expired driver's license.

# Extend your driver's license
If you are out of state and cannot renew, you may request a one year extension of your driver's license. Before your driver's license expires, submit a request with your name, driver's license number, birth date, California residence address, and out of state address.
