# Driver's license test

## 1. Vision test
DMV tests ensure all applicants can see well enough to drive safely. If you don't pass you will be asked to have your eye doctor complete a report of vision examination.

## 2. Knowledge test
you must pass the knowledge test with multiple choice questions. You are allowed 3 attempts to pass before you must reapply.

## 3. Behind-the-Wheel drive test
You will be tested on your ability to safely drive a vehicle. The examiner may give two or more instructions at one time to determine whether you can understand and properly follow both directions.

### On the day of your behind-the-wheel test, you must bring
1. your instruction permit or driver's license
2. Another California licensed driver who is at least 18 years old, unless you are already licensed to drive
3. A vehicle that is safe to drive for your test.
4. Valid proof of insurance and vehicle registration
5. if you plan to use a rental vehicle for your drive test, your name must be listed on the rental contract. The contract must not exclude behind-the-wheel drive tests
