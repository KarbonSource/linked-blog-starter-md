# SECTION 5. An Introduction to Driving 
Your health may affect your driving.

- Vision - you must be able to notice hazards in different types of lighting, judge distances, adjust to traffic speed, and read road signs.
- Hearing - you must be able to hear horns, sirens, motorcycles, or screeching tires that may alert you of hazards. It is illegal to wear a headset or earplugs in both ears while driving.
- Fatigue and Drowsiness - Can affect your vision and increase reaction time to hazards.
- Physical and Mental - you must be alert to quickly decide the correct course of action in any type of traffic situation, including unexpected ones.
- Medication - Prescription and over-the-counter medications can make you an unsafe driver. It is your responsibility to know the effects of the medications you take.
- Health - Physicians are required to report patients, who are at least 14 years old, to DMV for medical conditions that may affect your ability to drive safely.

# Controlling the vehicle

## Hand-to-Hand steering (push/pull)
1. Start with your hands at 9 and 3 o'clock or 8 and 4 o'clock
2. do not cross your hands over the middle of the steering wheel
3. keep your hands in these positions, even when making turns.

## Hand-over-Hand Steering
1. Star with your hands at 8 and 4 o'clock
2. Reach across the steering wheel to grasp the opposite side
3. Let go of the steering wheel with your other hand.
4. Reach across the arm still holding the wheel, grip the wheel, and pull up

## One-Hand steering
there are only two situations that may require steering with one hand:
- When you are turning while backing up to see where you are going behind you. Place your hand at the 12 o'clock position on the steering wheel
- When you are operating vehicle controls that require you to remove a hand from the steering wheel

# Signals, Horns, and Headlights
your signals, horn and headlights are important for communicating with other driver, pedestrians and bicyclists.

## Signaling
Always Signal when you turn, change lanes, slow down, or stop

You can signal using your vehicle's signal lights or using hand-and-arm positions. If your signal lights are not functioning, or bright sunlight makes your signal lights hard to see, use the hand-and-arm signals

You should signal:
- At least 100 feet before you turn
- before every lane change
- at least five seconds before you change lanes on a freeway
- before pulling next to the curb or away from the curb
- even when you do not see other vehicles around you
- when you are almost through the intersection if you plan to turn shortly after crossing the intersection

# Using your Horn
Use your vehicle's horn to let other drivers know you are there or warn others of a hazard. Use your horn to:
- Avoid collisions
- Alert oncoming traffic on narrow mountain roads where you cannot see at
