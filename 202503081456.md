Abstract:

Introduction:

Experiment Details:
Figure 1:
The figure of they system above is called “An Atwood’s machine” which can be described as the as two masses attached to a string that bends around a pulley and both of the masses are accelerating. In this experiment, a cart with a force sensor attached to it is held in place until it is eventually released. The hanging mass will accelerating downward and as a result will pull the cart that is on top of a track due to the string towards the pulley until the cart collides with the end stop.

Results and Analysis:
FBD 1 and 2:
The mass of the cart was measured to weigh about 0.689 kg and the mass of the hanging mass is about 0.200 kg.
