Chapter 1

Our First meeting







"Hydro, this is Victor, don't be shy say 'Hi'", my mother holding my hand into an unfamiliar house, stands a tall man in front of the doorway.

"Nice to meet you Hydro, your mother talks all about you. I think there's someone you'll get along with very well" he says while crouching down to eye level.

In the corner of my eyes I spot someone peeking around the kitchen. Her emerald green eyes, her black hair in pigtails

"Heal, c'mon say hi to Hydro", the girl steps out, she's wearing a very nice white blouse with a purple bowtie, and a purple skirt with white socks to match.

"Hello, my name is 'Heal' you're 'Hydro'", right?" she has a cheerful tone, eyes beaming with curiosity.

"Oh um... yeah, I'm Hydro, nice to meet you... um Heal" I'm not sure why, but I struggled uttering those words. Gladly this didn't last long, talking to her soon became as natural as ever
