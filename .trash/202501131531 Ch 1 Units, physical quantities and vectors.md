# 1.1 The nature of physics
Physics can be described as a experimental science. Physicists observe the phenomena of nature and try to find patterns from experiments. These are called physical [[202501131925 Theory|theories]] or when they are very well established and widely used physical laws and principles.

In order for a Physical [[202501131925 Theory|theory]] to be developed an appropriate question must be asked and a experiment must be created to answer said question and draw a conclusion from the result.

# 1.2 Solving physics problems
In physics understanding a concepts means being able to apply it to a variety of problems. Learning how to solve problems is essential

This book will give you problem solving strategies and at the end of each chapter there will bridging problems

[[202501132001 I SEE|I SEE]] - short for identify, set up, execute, and evaluate.

## Idealized Models
we use the word "model" to mean either a small scale replica. In physics a model is a simplified version of a physical system that would be too complicated to analyze in full detail
 We have to be careful that we don't neglect too much.

# 1.3 Standards and Units
Experiments require measurements and we generally use numbers to describe the result of measurements. Any number that is used to describe a physical phenomenon quantitatively is called a [[202501140838 Physical Quantity|physical quantity]]

Sometimes we define a [[202501140838 Physical Quantity|physical quantity]] by describing how to calculate it from other quantities we can measure such as speed (distance (m) over time (s))

# 1.4 Using and converting units
We use equations to express relationships among physical quantities represented by algebraic symbols (example d=vt)

# 1.5 Uncertainty and significant figures
Measurements have uncertainties. The uncertainty is also called the error because it indicates the maximum difference there is likely to be between the measured value and the true value

We indicate the accuracy of a measured value with the symbol ±. We can also express accuracy in terms of the maximum likely fractional error or percent error
