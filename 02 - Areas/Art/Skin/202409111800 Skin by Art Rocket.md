# Color Palette
Skin has way too many tones. It can be very light, very dark, or somewhere in between

# Base Color
Fill the area you want to color with the base color first.
this should be brighter than the final skin tone that you want to have. This is because we will add darker shading later.

# Shading
ask yourself where should the light come from?. Create a new clipping layer. For shading it is good to use more than one color it will make your drawing more pleasing to look at and less boring. It should be darker than the base. They usually use two tones.
Areas they shade: the eyes, under the nose, the lips, the nose, the neck, and on the forehead under the hair.

# Highlights
They personally use a whitish color for bright skin and they use light pink or brown tones for darker skin
