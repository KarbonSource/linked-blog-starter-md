Abstract: The goal is to observe two objects colliding under several conditions and analyze what is happening to the momentum of each object.

Introduction: The conservation of momentum can be described as the… An inelastic collision can be described as a collision where two objects stick together after they collide. An elastic collision is where two objects are still separate after they collide.

Experiment details: With a cart in front of a motion detector, it is pushed towards another cart that is either also moving towards the cart or is in a state of equilibrium. The two carts will collide or in one case the cart will collide with a part of the table.
