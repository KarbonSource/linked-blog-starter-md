# 20250206
It has been well over 3 and a half months since my last entry, I have once again returned to the college life in the same class I dropped last year, physics 006. It is going a lot better than last year as I scored well above everyone else. A couple days ago I finished lab 3 which involved excel, nothing too crazy. I am wondering how I'm gonna write this lab report, I feel like it will be awkward.
