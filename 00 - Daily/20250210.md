I feel a little bit better than the last couple of days, but this sense of dread looms over me. This lingering feeling of wanting to leave the server and my friends, just to be alone. I don't really understand why I feel this way, but I do. Would leaving everyone and everything behind free me from the sorrow I feel, how so? Is this really the key to my happiness? If so, why do I find myself returning after the last couple of times I left them? Why didn't I just stay gone then? Is it my fear of being abandoned? Isn't it contradicting to abandon them? What is the difference between being abandoned and the one to abandon?
