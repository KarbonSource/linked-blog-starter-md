Today I got a new plugin for obsidian called web viewer, kinda cool. You can access web pages within obsidian. The adblock is not so great, so gonna have to figure that one out.

I tried to access my POP OS partition, I can't seem to do it though. I want to move files from that partition to windows, because I'm running out of space.

Today I'm hoping to get a head start on reading chapter 5 and maybe finishing it this weekend, then do some of my lab report.

I'm looking up a plugin for creating Latex commands or hotkeys. This is not completed using quickadd plugin.

Today was going well until I began thinking about that bastard again. I couldn't help but cry remembering all those times. I haven't been productive at all, it has really affected my ability to do work. It was going so well today too. Thinking about those times when he would yell at me; god I hate that asshole. No work is getting done, I'm gonna just go to bed. Tomorrow will be a new day.
