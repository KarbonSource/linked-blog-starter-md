Today I got a new plugin for obsidian called web viewer, kinda cool. You can access web pages within obsidian. The adblock is not so great, so gonna have to figure that one out.

I tried to access my POP OS partition, I can't seem to do it though. I want to move files from that partition to windows, because I'm running out of space.

Today I'm hoping to get a head start on reading chapter 5 and maybe finishing it this weekend, then do some of my lab report.
