After about a month and a half, I make another entry. I have returned to the college life in the same class I dropped last year, Phys 006. It is going much better than last year, I have scores on my homework and lab. On Tuesday I finished a lab about excel and making graphs. I'm not sure how I'm gonna write this lab report as there is very little material.
