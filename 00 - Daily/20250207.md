After about a month and a half, I make another entry. I have returned to the college life in the same class I dropped last year, Phys 006. It is going much better than last year, I have scores on my homework and lab. On Tuesday I finished a lab about excel and making graphs. I'm not sure how I'm gonna write this lab report as there is very little material.

I’m in lecture today it seems like a former student for Professor Lutz is talking in front of class. She says to read over and rewrite the notes from her class. She graduated top of her class with two kids at home. Gotta make sacrifices and make time for it.
