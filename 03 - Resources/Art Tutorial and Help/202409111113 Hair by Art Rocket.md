# Sketching
They start by just thinking about the general outline, not paying attention to the details.
It is good to work with s curves even when the hair is straight. It can be a long open S, making the hair look light and flowy. With wavy hair, the S Curve will be more visible.\

# About lineart
Erase messy lines and go over them when necessary. You don't need to over-zoom and glue your face on the screen to be sure the lines are perfect. You are most likely to be the only one that will be able to spot your small mistakes.
In this phase, you can make the lines thicker where they intersect or where shadows will be, as it will give your lines more depth.

Once the general shape is defined, you can polish it until your liking. But as you are still learning, you don't need to go fancy on the shading. Go slowly, within the scope of what you feel is challenging enough for your current skills, then make it complex as you go.

# Highlights
They state that this is the fun part, they may be right. They like to use the airbrush the skin color on the bangs, so when they add white highlights on top, it will show.
If you don't know what color to use, you can take the hair color, create a new layer, set the blending mode to add (glow), and then add blobs, triangles, lines, etc. then use hue and saturation to change the color to a tone that matches.
