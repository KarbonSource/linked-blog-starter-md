# 1st Child - Kao (镧 - Lan)
The first child and the oldest son of King Pan. A humble kind child with a permanent smile on his face. This child holds no interest of the throne after King Pan's death, but regardless partakes in the sibling war. He respects all of his younger siblings, but the one holds a special place in his heart is his youngest sibling Chengx, as he bared the responsibility of taking care of Chengx.

# 12th Child - Chengx
The last and youngest child of King Pan
