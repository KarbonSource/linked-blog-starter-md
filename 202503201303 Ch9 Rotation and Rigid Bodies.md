# 9.1 Angular Velocity and Acceleration
![[202503201303 Ch9 Rotation and Rigid Bodies.png]]
The angular coordinate $\theta$ of a rigid body rotating around a fixed axis can be both positive and negative, depending on which to be positive or negative to be clockwise or counterclockwise.

The most natural way to measure the angle $\theta$ is not in degrees but in **radians**.

$\theta=\frac{s}{r}$ or $s=r\theta$

An angle in radians is the ratio of two lengths, so it is a pure number, without dimensions.

The circumference of a circle is 2$\pi$ times the radius, so there are 2$\pi$ (about 6.283) radians in one complete revolution therefore

1 rad = $\frac{360^{o}}{2\pi}$ = 57.3<sup>o</sup>
